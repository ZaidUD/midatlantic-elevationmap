# Mid-Atlantic CHM and Digital Elevation Models Dataset

This dataset delivers high‑resolution (1‑meter per pixel) Canopy Height Models (CHMs) and Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) for the mid‑Atlantic United States. The products are generated by training Deep‑Learning (DL) models concurrently on high‑resolution multispectral imagery and high-resolution LiDAR samples from NSF’s NEON (National Ecological Observatory Network) project, which provide supervisory signals during training. This fusion yields a cost‑effective, scalable alternative and complement to wall‑to‑wall airborne LiDAR surveys, producing highly accurate canopy structure estimates that improve upon the quality of current DL‑based CHM products. Developed through innovative PhD research at the University of Delaware, the dataset supports applications across ecology, forestry, urban planning, hydrology, and climate science, from biodiversity conservation to disaster preparedness. The data are freely available to accelerate research and inform decision‑making across disciplines. 

The dataset is based on multispectral imagery acquired in 2023 and will be updated with 2025 imagery. Additional temporal layers can be produced whenever new high-resolution multispectral data become available, either captured or DL-super-resolved, enabling ongoing monitoring over time.

## Impact

This dataset’s high resolution and open access enable transformative applications across multiple fields:
- **Ecology and Biodiversity**: Maps habitats for species like birds and mammals, monitors invasive species, and assesses ecosystem health in mid-Atlantic forests.
- **Forestry**: Estimates above-ground biomass for carbon accounting, monitors forest health, and supports sustainable timber management.
- **Urban Planning**: Guides urban forestry and green space planning in cities like Philadelphia and Baltimore, mitigating urban heat islands.
- **Hydrology**: Models flood risks and watershed dynamics in the Mid-Atlantic region, aiding water resource management.
- **Disaster Management**: Assesses wildfire risks and post-storm vegetation damage, enhancing resilience in coastal zones.
- **Climate Research**: Supports carbon sequestration studies and land use change analysis under climate scenarios.

**Stakeholders** include _University of Delaware departments_ (Geography and Spatial Sciences, Plant and Soil Sciences, Data Science Institute, College of Earth, Ocean and Environment, College of Civil Engineering, College of Agriculture, among others), _government agencies_ (USGS, Delaware DNREC, Chesapeake Bay Program), _private sectors_ (environmental consulting, agrotech), and _global researchers_. Open access amplifies collaboration, enabling interdisciplinary research and policy decisions.

## Generation Process

### Methodology

The CHM and DEM are generated using a deep generative learning model designed for image translation pretrained on depth estimation. The model was trained to estimate vegetation height from 1m-resolution multispectral imagery, leveraging image-translation and depth estimation techniques to generate a realistic elevation model.

The canopy height model (CHM) and digital elevation model (DEM) are generated using a deep generative learning model for image translation, pretrained on depth estimation. For training, the model used [High-resolution orthorectified camera imagery mosaic](https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP3.30010.001) (multispectral) and [Ecosystem structure](https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP3.30015.001) (CHM) from the NSF [NEON project](https://data.neonscience.org/). The NEON multispectral imagery, originally collected at 0.1-meter resolution, was resampled to 1 meter per pixel. The CHM was derived from airborne LiDAR point clouds with sub-meter accuracy, also aggregated to 1-meter resolution. The model was trained to take the multispectral bands as input and generate the corresponding CHM.

The performance of the model was evaluated on a testing set of images never seen by the model, achieving a mean absolute error of 2.74 meters and a root mean squared error of 4.53 meters.

During inference, the model used high-resolution (1m) multispectral imagery from the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP), collected during leaf-on conditions in 2023. NAIP imagery provides red, green, blue, and near infrared bands, capturing detailed vegetation patterns across the Mid-Atlantic.

Limitations include reduced accuracy in urban areas with sparse vegetation or under cloud-covered RGB inputs or out-of-distribution camera settings for the multispectral imagery.

### Output

- **File Format**: GeoTIFF, georeferenced to EPSG:32618 (UTM Zone 18N).
- **Structure**: Tiled rasters by state for manageable processing (e.g., `DE/pred_m_3807513_nw_18_030_20230712_20230919.tif`).
- **CHM Characteristics**: Pixel values represent vegetation height in meters relative to ground elevation, ranging from 0 (ground or low vegetation) to 50 meters for tall trees. Each tile includes metadata on spatial extent and projection.
